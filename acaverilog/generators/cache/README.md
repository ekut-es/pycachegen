Things are a bit messy atm; outside of this directory there is as `cache_generator.py`. Right now it doesn't inherit from the ModuleGenerator class because of import errors, but one day it will. Anyway, inside of this directory you've got a CMakeLists.txt that will call the cache_generator.py to create src/cache.v (you might have to create the parent dir first...). You have to call cmake from a build directory which you have to create here. Then you can just do things normally, like call ninja and execute the executable and then inspect the trace.
